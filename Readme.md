Library of Infineon's 3D magnetic sensor TLE493D family (currently supporting W2B6, A2B6 and P2B6) for Arduino. Notice that it is enough to use the class **Tle493d** if you want to use the basic setup. Classes **Tle493d-w2b6**, **Tle493d-a2b6** and **Tle493d-p2b6** offers additional device-specific features. 

## Summary
The 3D Magnetic Sensor 2GO is a budget-priced evaluation board equipped with the magnetic sensor [TLE493D](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/sensor/magnetic-position-sensor/3d-magnetic-sensor/tle493d-w2b6-a0/) for three dimensional measurement combined with an ARM® Cortex™-M0 CPU. The 3D Magnetic Sensor 2GO has a complete set of on-board devices, including an on-board debugger. Build your own application and gadget with the 3D Magnetic Sensor 2GO.

## Usage
Please follow the example sketches in the /examples directory in this library to learn more about the usage of the library.

Currently you have to make sure which sensor type you are using. The default type is `A0`:
```
Tle493d(AccessMode_e mode = MASTERCONTROLLEDMODE, TypeAddress_e productType = TLE493D_A0);
```
## Known Issues
- Reset sequence not working for TLE493d-W2B6. (Requires further testing)
```
mInterface.bus->begin();
mInterface.bus->write(0xFF);
mInterface.bus->end();

mInterface.bus->begin();
mInterface.bus->write(0xFF);
mInterface.bus->end();

mInterface.bus->begin();
mInterface.bus->write(0x00);
mInterface.bus->end();

mInterface.bus->begin();
mInterface.bus->write(0x00);
mInterface.bus->end();
```

- TLE493D-A2B6 does not work with low power mode.

- Sensor does not respond after being reconnected.
  As mentioned in [this issue](https://github.com/Infineon/TLE493D-3DMagnetic-Sensor/issues/6), the sensor works after being flashed, but not after being powered off and powered on again.
  This is temporarily solved by twice writing out the configuration registers, in order to avoid unexpected INT pulse.

## Key Features and Benefits
* TLE493D-A2B6 and TLE493D-W2B6 (three dimensional magnetic sensor)
* XMC1100 (ARM® Cortex™-M0 based)
* On-board J-Link Lite Debugger (Realized with XMC4200 Microcontroller)
* Power over USB (Micro USB), ESD and reverse current protection

## Installation
### Integration of XMC in Arduino IDE
Please note that base of the Sensors 2GO is the XMC 2Go from Infineon. Therefore, please install (if not already done) also the [XMC-for-Arduino](https://github.com/Infineon/XMC-for-Arduino) implementation and choose afterwards **XMC2Go** from the **Tools**>**Board** menu in the Arduino IDE if working with this evaluation board.

### Integration of Library
Please download this repository from GitHub by clicking on the following field in the [releases](https://github.com/Infineon/TLE493D-W2B6-3DMagnetic-Sensor/releases) of this repository or directly [here](https://github.com/Infineon/TLE493D-W2B6-3DMagnetic-Sensor/releases/download/V1.0.1/TLE493D-W2B6-3DMagnetic-Sensor.zip):

## Processing
This library supports the open-source software [Processing](https://processing.org/) for creating GUIs. It allows you to connect your evaluation board to a PC over serial communication and visualisation of the embedded system. Find out more on the Arduino homepage [here](http://playground.arduino.cc/Interfacing/Processing). The respective files are stored in the /processing folder of this repository.

## 3D Printed Add-Ons

The TLx493D eval kit can be combined with several 3D printed mechanical add-ons. Designed to fit the 2Go form factor for quick and easy evaluation of common magnetic mechanical applications. Find out all the available 3D Printed add-ons [here](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/sensor/magnetic-sensors/magnetic-position-sensors/3d-magnetics/#!boards).

## 3D printing files and GUI

Download [here](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/tle493d-w2b6-ms2go/#!tools) the 3D printing files for the mechanical add-ons. 
You can also find a GUI there for a first evaluation of those add-ons.

### Mini Controller with Python

The [Mini Control 2Go](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/mini_control2go/) 3D printer add-ons extends the TLE493D functionalities with several python scripts support. Check out the code in the following [repository](https://github.com/Infineon/magnetic-3d-mini-controller).
